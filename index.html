            <code>::Hello, World::</code>
            <p>Architecting, designing, and implementing software systems is a strong professional and personal interest
                of mine. Whether I'm working on cloud, containers, systems; I love to dive into the technical deep-end
                of various areas of the tech space.</p>

            <p>My experience engineering solutions spans the full stack: from system and database administration, to
                microservice development, to dev-ops and continuous delivery, to single-page applications, to container
                orchestration, to mobile apps, to automated infrastructure management. My focus lately has been on
                end-to-end holistic solutions engineering, and embracing every facet of the tech stack.</p>

            <code>::System and Database Administration::</code>
            <p>Through my experience as a system and database administrator, I found an area I truly loved. From 2013 I
                worked with database systems including Oracle DB and MySQL, and maintained virtual machines across
                multiple server racks with VMWare ESXi to provision Windows Server and RHEL machines. There were various
                areas of my role that I found could prove more effectively managed by developing automated maintenance
                strategies; I touched down on automated backups and log monitoring for internal services as my first
                step towards development. This is where my interests in software engineering really grew.</p>
            <p>While I maintained my position as a system adminstrator and database administrator, I sought out and
                implemented automation tooling around common tasks to reduce toil. I worked on internal services that
                would allow for easier work on the intranet, be it servers, hardware devices, and more. These include,
                but are not limited to, Python management services and backends, Active Directory hooks in Go, and web
                clients in Javascript. The road unfolded and I enrolled in Computer Science at Oakland University to
                continue my journey.</p>

            <code>::Open Source::</code>
            <p>I have long been a lover of the open source mantra and free software technologies such as Linux, GNU, and
                Git. Prior to my work as a system and database administrator, I dug into Linux for my personal devices.
                Experimenting with various tools and technologies is a long-time hobby of mine, and I tried different
                server operating systems such as CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu. I started off with Linux on my old shabby
                laptop with Fedora, and tried out a number of distributions over the years. By the way, I run Arch.</p>

            <code>::Computer Science::</code>
            <p>Through-out my schooling I have studied computer theory, software engineering, networking, operating
                systems, programming languages, and more. The curriculum alone was never really enough, and I spent time
                outside of school learning about various technologies like message queues, distributed systems, and
                containerization technologies like Docker. The premise of a kernel-level feature like cgroups providing
                strong mechanisms for isolated process environments was fascinating to me, and I found another interest
                then: DevOps. Having already worked for years as a system administrator and understanding the areas
                where automating functionality was hugely beneficial, I focused projects on more software around these
                practices. I contributed to open source software around version source control, and built out complete
                DevOps pipeline solutions implemented with distributed containerized systems. I provided a similar
                solution at my work to deliver a more up-to-date service for our development team.</p>

            <code>::Software Engineering::</code>
            <p>Eventually I moved into a software engineering role, and joined Ally Financial in 2017. During my time
                there I worked on several projects. My first work was a project undergoing a migration from mainframe,
                where we envisioned a complete re-architecture of our central mainframe program into a massive series of
                microservices, batch operations, message queues, and COTS services. I designed security software for
                compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, developed data pipelines with DataStage, and engineered various
                utility services to assist our business analysts with requirements. In 2018 I later joined on a legacy
                application, working with J2EE and Struts with deployements to mainframe. I worked on quarterly releases
                and helped provide insight into automation technology and future steps for our digital transformation
                roadmap. Later on in 2018, I moved on to a project deploying to the OpenShift containerization platform,
                developing services that provided massive parallel operations and data processing. I worked with Spring
                Boot microservices with Redis as a cache for MapReduce operations. I also encorporated log monitoring
                with Splunk and AppDynamics for application performance monitoring. I was requested to join another team
                end-of-year 2018 and began work on my last project at Ally. I worked on Spring Boot microservices with
                an Angular front-end. I worked across the entire stack, developing Jenkins pipelines for continuous
                integration and delivery, implementing back-end services in Java, engineered our service authentication
                for our Docker containers, developed Helm templates for our OpenShift deployments, and architecting our
                performance-first lazily-loaded Angular front-end.</p>

            <code>::Full Stack::</code>
            <p>I eventually left Ally in 2019 to join Dynatrace, a company at the forefront of distributed tracing and
                application performance monitoring. Today, their solution provides users actionable insights into their
                production environments across mainframes, back-end, front-end, mobile apps, websites... My initial role
                at the company was on the Davis Assistant team, which provides a virtual assistant that interfaces with
                customers via a web application, voice integrations with Google Assistant and Alexa, and multi-user
                integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams. My work there has included several projects I have been
                fond of, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Re-architecting the notification pipeline to provide reactice, robust, and resilient notification
                    deliveries for handling various error scenarios</li>
                <li>Engineering an extensive pipeline to automatically ensure code complies with our unit tests, builds
                    and minimizes bundles for efficient service deployments</li>
                <li>Implementing the Microsoft Teams third-party integration for direct and multi-user messaging with
                    our natural language processing back-end and Teams native tabs with React</li>
                <li>Created the Dialogflow-as-Code project which provides declarative management of Dialogflow resources
                    on the Google Cloud Platform to maximize our teams velocity of NLP enhancements, provide static type
                    safety to our internal NLP resources, and automate deployments through environments in my continuous
                    delivery pipeline</li>
            </ul>

            <code>::Teamwork::</code>
            <p>I love to dive deep in whatever area I work in, whether I am designing Docker containers or writing web
                applications, but I always provide feedback and help whenever my peers are in need. I also serve as my
                teams Scrum Master to faciliate meetings, resolve task estimates, and ensure the team grows together
                while working to enhancing our sprint velocity and stability.
            </p>

            <code>::So, Me::</code>
            <p>I am extremely passionate in engineering solutions around complex problems, automating redundant
                operations, writing code, bringing users great experiences, reducing toil, and implementing practices
                that keeps my phone from buzzing in the late hours of the night.</p>
